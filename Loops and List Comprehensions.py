#range() is a function that returns a sequence of numbers. It turns out to be very useful for writing loops.

#while loops
#The other type of loop in Python is a while loop, which iterates until some condition is met:

i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i, end=' ')
    i += 1 # increase the value of i by

squares

[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

#Here's how we would do the same thing without a list comprehension:

squares = []
for n in range(10):
    squares.append(n**2)
squares

#We can also add an if condition:

short_planets = [planet for planet in planets if len(planet) < 6]
short_planets

#with an if condition and applying some transformation to the loop variable:

# str.upper() returns an all-caps version of a string
loud_short_planets = [planet.upper() + '!' for planet in planets if len(planet) < 6]
loud_short_planets

['VENUS!', 'EARTH!', 'MARS!']
